<h3>Theo, Amartya, Charlotte, Hernando, Camillo, Rui, Vilhelm</h3>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Bike sharing is a service provided now by several major cities around the world. Data is regularly and automatically collected on this services by the renting system. Analyzing it can help predict usage levels and effectively provide a ‘map‘ of the city traffic activity and hot spots. The dataset corresponds to Washington DC​ but many equivalent datasets are available for other cities , including Madrid​.</p>
<h2>Objective:</h2>
<p>Build a predictive model capable of predicting the total number of bike rentals per hour for a given weekday. Note​ you may also want to add weather information to improve model accuracy, i.e , be able to predict nb of bike rentals per hour for weekday and weather conditions , or even add more features (like e.g. : bank holidays information)</p>
